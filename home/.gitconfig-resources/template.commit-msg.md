# Fixes #123, so reference that: [GitHub will close the issue][keywords]
# if you use: `close`, `closes`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`,
# `resolve`, `resolves`, or `resolved`. Don't put those keywords
# in front of an issue that is not fixed, just reference that #124
# is related, and if it's in another repository, reference it like
# organization/octo-repo#1000 it doesn’t even have to be an issue;
# that right there’s a pull request, and GitHub links the two together
# just as readily as if they were issues and PRs from a single repo.
# 
# - Every can agree on two things
#   - lists are great
#   - they convey lots of info
# 
# If you’re in a rush, write some poetry.
